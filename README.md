# RedBadger-MartianRobot exercise solution

## How to run

`make run` runs *main.py*

`make test` runs *tests/test_board.py*

If needed, custom filenames can be passed as such
`python main.py -f moving_test.txt`

## Areas to improve
- CI/CD
- Better error handling
- Reading file line by line. Storing massive files in memory could become problematic
